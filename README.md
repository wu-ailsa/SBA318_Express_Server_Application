# SBA 318: Express Server Application

## Introduction
This assessment measures your understanding of Node and Express and your capability to implement their features in a practical manner. You have creative freedom in the topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have fun with it! However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the timeline you have been given.

## Objectives
* Create a server application with Node and Express.
* Create a RESTful API using Express.
* Create Express middleware.
* Use Express middleware.
* Use a template engine to render views with Express.

## Submission
Submit the link to your completed assessment using the Start Assignment button on the Assignment page in Canvas.
Your submission should include:
* A link to the GitHub repository for your project.
## Instructions
You will create a small Node and Express server application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you; be creative!

Your work will be graded according to the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have the time.

Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. This will also help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.

Once you have an idea in mind, briefly discuss it with your instructors to determine if it is appropriate for the amount of time you have been given.

Since topic and content are secondary to functionality for this assessment, we have included some resources below for free content that you can use to populate your application. Once you have gotten your functionality in place, you can return and fill in the content with something interesting.

## Requirements
The requirements listed here are absolute minimums. Ensure that your application meets these requirements before attempting to further expand your features.

- [x] Create and use at least two pieces of custom middleware.
- [x] Create and use error-handling middleware.
- [x] Use at least three different data categories (e.g., users, posts, or comments).
- [ ] Utilize reasonable data structuring practices.
- [ ] Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client.
- [ ] Utilize route parameters, where appropriate.
- [ ] Adhere to the guiding principles of REST.
- [x] Create and render at least one view using a view template and template engine. This can be a custom template engine or a third-party engine.
- [x] Use simple CSS to style the rendered views.
- [x] Utilize reasonable code organization practices.
- [ ] Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
- [x] Commit frequently to the git repository.
- [x] Include a README file that contains a description of your application.
- [ ] Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.
